### `public/` Folder 

The `public/` folder in a Next.js project is used to store **static assets** that do not go through Webpack processing. These files are directly served as they are.

#### **Usage**
- Any file placed in `public/` is accessible via `/yourfile.ext`.
- Example: A file `public/logo.png` can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000/logo.png`.
- It is useful for storing:
  - **Images** (logos, favicons, static backgrounds)
  - **Fonts** (custom fonts not imported via CSS)
  - **Robots.txt & Sitemap.xml** (for SEO)
  - **Static JSON files** (if you need to store configuration or mock data)

#### **What Not to Put Here?**
- **JavaScript, TypeScript, or CSS files** (those should go inside `src/`).
- **Dynamic content** (this folder is only for static assets).
